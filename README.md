# MESS: Multiproposal Elliptical Slice Sampling

This repository implements Elliptical Slice Sampling (ESS) and its multiproposal generalization (MESS) for Bayesian inference in models with Gaussian priors. It accompanies the pre-print "Multproposal Elliptical Slice Sampling" by Senn et al. (2026).

## Key concepts

### ESS and MESS

- ESS is recovered by setting M = 1.
- MESS proposes M candidate angles per subiteration and accepts one uniformly or based on a transition matrix.
- All algorithms require: sampling from a Gaussian prior and evaluating a log-likelihood.

---

## Design principles

1. Algorithms are model-agnostic
   - Samplers only need a prior sampler and a log-likelihood.

2. Each problem constructs its own prior
   - Prior mean and covariance are derived in the problem class.
   - Problems considered: examples 1 (GP) and 2 (LR) in Murray et. al (2010), Semi-Blind Deconvolution from Senn et al. (2025, 2026), toy model for solute transport from Glatt-Holtz et al. (2024).

3. Gaussian priors only
   - All problems inherit from GaussianPriorProblem.
   - Gaussian sampling is performed via Cholesky decomposition.

## Typical usage

```python
import numpy as np
from mess.data.gp_regression import generate_gp_regression_data
from mess.problems.gp_regression import GaussianProcessRegression
from mess.algorithms.ess import ess_step

data = generate_gp_regression_data(seed=0)
problem = GaussianProcessRegression(
    X=data["X"],
    y=data["y"],
    length_scale=1.0,
    noise_variance=0.09,
)

x = data["f_init"]
rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
for _ in range(1000):
    x, _, _ = ess_step(x, problem, rng)
```
